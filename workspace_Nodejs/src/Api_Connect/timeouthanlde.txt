About both Get and Post methods:

The timeout can occur as a socket disconnect, so you must register its handler like:

request.on('socket', function (socket) {
        socket.setTimeout( self.timeout );
        socket.on('timeout', function() {
            request.abort();
            if(timeout) return timeout( new Error('request timed out') );
        });
    });
while the request handler is

       request.on('timeout', function () {
          // Timeout happend. Server received request, but not handled it
          // (i.e. doesn't send any response or it took to long).
          // You don't know what happend.
          // It will emit 'error' message as well (with ECONNRESET code).
          req.abort();
          if(timeout) return timeout( new Error('request timed out') );
        });
